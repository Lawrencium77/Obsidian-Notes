The dude's [blog](https://blog.nelhage.com/post/computers-can-be-understood/) is sick. So I decided I'd keep a record of anything super cool I found!

## Computers Can Be Understood
[This blog](https://blog.nelhage.com/post/computers-can-be-understood/) explains the mindset that Nelson takes to working with software.

At their core, computers are built on a set of deterministic foundations. There is no magic.

The most direct manifestation of this is to understand your dependencies. Nelson often has **checkouts of libraries' source code on his computer**.

A deeply related habit is to build **mental models**.

He mentions some pitfalls:

* The need to understand can be harmful when working atop a complex system, where your problem does not fundamentally require understanding the whole thing.

Learning more about software systems is a compounding skill. The more systems youâ€™ve seen, the more patterns you have available to match future systems against, and the more skills and tricks and techniques you develop to apply to future problems.

## Software Engineers Should Keep Lab Notebooks
Nelson's opinion is that most software engineers' inability to work in a lab-notebook style, where you meticulously document your work, is unfortunate and often seriously detrimental to their work.

Debugging is very much a problem of gathering data and making and testing hypotheses. For subtle bugs in large programs, the amount of state you need to keep track of can rapidly get out of hand.

## A Cursed Bug

I just made straight Ankis on this one.
