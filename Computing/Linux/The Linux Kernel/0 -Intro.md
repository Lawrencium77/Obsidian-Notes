These notes are based upon [this](https://tldp.org/LDP/tlk/tlk-title.html) book, which is part of [The Linux Documentation Project](https://tldp.org/guides.html). It describes itself as follows:

> "This book is for Linux enthusiasts who want to know how the Linux kernel works. It is not an internals manual. Rather it describes the principles and mechanisms that Linux uses; how and why the Linux kernel works the way that it does."

It contains the following chapters:

1. [Hardware Basics](1%20-%20Hardware%20Basics.md)
2. [Software Basics](2%20-%20Software%20Basics.md)
3. Memory Management
4. [Processes](4%20-%20Processes.md)
5. [Interprocess Communication Mechanisms](5%20-%20Interprocess%20Communication%20Mechanisms.md)
6. PCI
7. Interrupts and Interrupt Handling
8. Device Drivers
9. The File System
10. Networks
11. Kernel Mechanisms
12. Modules
13. Processors
14. The Linux Kernel Sources
15. Linux Data Structures

Some of these were really useful. Others, less so. The less useful chapters either covered material I was familiar with, or was a bit esoteric. 
I only made notes on the good bits!
