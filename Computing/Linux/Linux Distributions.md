The term "Linux", in the context of operating systems, refers to any operating system that runs the Linux kernel. Other components of the OS, such as the package manager, can vary. The term [Linux distribution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux_distribution) (aka "distro") refers to the entire operating system. A typical distribution contains a Linux kernel, GNU tools and libraries, a package manager, and other software.

Almost 1000 Linux distributions exist. Examples include:

* Ubuntu (very widely used).
* Debian (used as a base for other distros, including Ubuntu).
* Arch Linux (allows a high level of control).
* Kali Linux (Debian-based design. Contains software tools useful for pen testing).

Their corresponding package managers are:

* apt (Advanced Package Tool)
* apt
* Pacman
* apt

As a useful comparison, macOS doesn't come with an in-built package manager. However, there are several third-party package managers. The most popular of these is [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) (which can also be used for Linux).
