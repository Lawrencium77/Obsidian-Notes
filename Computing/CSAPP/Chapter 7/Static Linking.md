**Static linkers** such as the Linux `ld` program take as input a collection of **relocatable object files** and generate an **executable object file** that can be loaded and run. The input relocatable object files consist of various code and data sections. Instructions are in one section, initialised global variables are in another, and uninitialised variables are in yet another.

To build the executable, the linker must perform two main tasks:

1. **Symbol Resolution**: Object files define and reference **symbols**, where each symbol corresponds to a function, a global variable, or a [static variable](Educative%20Course#Automatic%20vs%20Static%20Variables) (i.e., any C variable declared as `static`). The purpose of symbol resolution is to associate each symbol *reference* with exactly one *definition*.
2. **Relocation**: Compilers and assemblers generate code and data sections that start at address `0`. The linker ***relocates*** these sections by associating a memory location with each symbol definition, and then modifying all of the references to those symbols so that they point to this memory location. The linker blindly performs these relocations using detailed instructions, generated by the assembler, called **relocation entries**.

For the rest of this chapter, it's worth keeping the following in mind:

* Object files are merely collections of blocks of bytes. 
* A linker concatenates blocks together, decides on run-time locations for the concatenated blocks, and modifies locations within the code and data blocks. The compilers and assemblers that generate object files have already done most of the work.
