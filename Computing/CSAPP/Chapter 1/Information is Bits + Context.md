The `hello` program begins life as a *source program*. This is represented as a sequence of bytes. Each byte represents some text character in the program. Most computer systems represent text characters using the ASCII standard, that represents each character with a unique byte-sized integer value.

Files that consist exclusively of ASCII characters are called **text files**. All other files are known as **binary files**.

There is a fundamental idea here: all information in a system is stored as bits. The only thing that distinguishes different data objects is the context in which we view them.
