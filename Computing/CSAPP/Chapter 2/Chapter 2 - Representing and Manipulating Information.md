In this chapter, we consider the ways to represent basic data types, such as approximations to integers and real arithmetic. The three most important representations of numbers are:

* **Unsigned** encodings, to represent positive integers;
* **Two's complement** encodings, to represent signed integers;
* **Floating-point** encodings, to represent real numbers
