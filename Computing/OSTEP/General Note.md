I read OSTEP after finishing CSAPP.

Upon reflection, my reading of CSAPP was very thorough but somewhat slow. 

To try improving my rate of learning, I therefore made fewer notes on OSTEP. I instead focus on using note-taking as a way to stay focused, and make Ankis more quickly than I did for CSAPP.
