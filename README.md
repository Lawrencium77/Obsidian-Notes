# Reading Notes

Outside of work hours, I enjoy reading about a variety of CS and ML topics.
I use Obsidian to make notes on what I find.

This repo is a public copy of my private notes. They are not intended to be blog-post quality. I cannot guarantee their correctness. The notes I've made more recently are no-doubt more interesting & technical than those I made 2 years ago.

Nonetheless, I hope that making these notes public can:

1. Provide some accountability - maybe this will motivate me to make my notes better.
2. Be of use to somebody else[^fn1].

As a general note, `./Computing/` probably has the highest average quality in this repo. 


[^fn1]: There's a chance that this is hopelessly optimistic.
