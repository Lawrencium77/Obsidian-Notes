# Reading Notes

Outside of work hours, I enjoy reading about a variety of CS and ML topics.
I use Obsidian to make notes on what I find.

This repo is a public copy of my private notes. They are not intended to be blog-post quality. I cannot guarantee their correctness. The notes I've made more recently are no doubt more interesting & technical than those I made two years ago.

Nonetheless, I hope that making these notes public can:

1. Provide some accountability - this may motivate me to improve my notes.
2. Be of use to somebody else[^fn1].

Generally, `./Computing/` probably has the highest average quality in this repo. 

I also have an Anki deck that complements the notes found here. [I've made this public too](https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/1575034413).


[^fn1]: There's a chance that this is hopelessly optimistic.
